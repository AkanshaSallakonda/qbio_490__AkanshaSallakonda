***Deliverables***
-Upload this R Notebook to your GitHub and submit the link to your Repo on BB.
-Include any graphs or figures created in this assignment in the folder with your R notebook with descriptive file names.

Since this is an optional partner activity, it is okay if your answers are the same as your partnerâ€™s as long as everyone understands it and could explain it in their own words if asked. Each person must individually push their code to Github. *At the top of your R Notebook, write the name of you and your partner(s) as a comment.*

***Complete the following coding activity and answer any following questions as comments in your R Notebook***

In Transcriptomics_Tutorial.Rmd, you learned how to manipulate the SummarizedExperiment data structure, turn it into more readable dataframes, complete basic analysis using those dataframes, and performed a differential expression analysis based on age. Before saving the rna_counts, rna_clinical, and rna_genes however, we masked out any sample that was not a tumor. In this assignment, you will need to reinstantiate the rna_se object and then perform differential expression analysis based on tumor status.

*Pre-Assignment*
Use knitr function to set your working directory to your analysis_data folder in qbio_490_name.
```{r}
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = normalizePath("/Users/akki/Desktop/USC/FreshmanYear/QBIO490/qbio_490_AkanshaSallakonda/analysis_data")) 
```


Load all necessary packages and instantiate the rna_se object
```{r}

if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install(version = "3.17")
if (!require("TCGAbiolinks", quietly = TRUE))
BiocManager::install("TCGAbiolinks")
if (!require("maftools", quietly = TRUE))
BiocManager::install("maftools")
if (!require("DESeq2", quietly = TRUE))
BiocManager::install("DESeq2")
if (!require("EnhancedVolcano", quietly = TRUE))
BiocManager::install("EnhancedVolcano")

library(BiocManager)
library(TCGAbiolinks)
library(maftools)
library(ggplot2)
library (SummarizedExperiment)
library(DESeq2)
library(EnhancedVolcano)

rna_query <- GDCquery(project ="TCGA-BRCA",
                      data.category = "Transcriptome Profiling",
                      data.type = "Gene Expression Quantification",
                      workflow.type = "STAR - Counts")


#GDCdownload(rna_query)
rna_se <- GDCprepare(rna_query)
```

```


*1*
Perform all data cleaning and label manipulation steps (hint: applying colnames and rownames to make the dataframes more readable) except for masking out the patient with an NA for age and the "Solid Tissue Normal" sample types.
```{r}

rna_clinical <- rna_se@colData
rna_clinical <- as.data.frame(rna_clinical)

treatments_mask <- ifelse(colnames(rna_clinical) == 'treatments',F,T)
rna_clinical <- rna_clinical[,treatments_mask]

primary_site_mask <- ifelse(colnames(rna_clinical) == 'primary_site', F,T)
rna_clinical <- rna_clinical[,primary_site_mask]

disease_type_mask <-ifelse(colnames(rna_clinical) == 'disease_type', F, T)
rna_clinical <- rna_clinical[,disease_type_mask]

rna_genes <- rna_se@rowRanges@elementMetadata
rna_genes <- as.data.frame(rna_genes)
rna_counts <- rna_se@assays@data$unstranded
rna_counts <- as.data.frame(rna_counts)

rna_clinical$age_category <- ifelse(rna_clinical$age_at_index <= 58, "young", "old")

age_NA_mask <- !is.na(rna_clinical$age_category)

#removing all NA values
rna_clinical <- rna_clinical[age_NA_mask, ]

rna_counts <- rna_counts[, age_NA_mask]

rownames(rna_genes) <- rna_genes$gene_id

rownames(rna_counts) <- rna_genes$gene_id
colnames(rna_counts) <- rownames(rna_clinical)

```

<<<<<<< HEAD
Determine and define your experimental design for the differential expression analysis. Control for covariance of age, gender, OR vital_status. Manipulate those columns so that they are ready for differential expression analysis (hint: what kind of variables are they? what data type are they by default? do you need to handle unknown values?)
